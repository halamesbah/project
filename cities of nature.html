        It's hard to truly grasp the magnitude of Bagan Archaeological Zone, dominated by thousands of temples, pagodas, and stupas. <br>Explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site on a bike (or e-bike to cover even more ground). For an eagle's-eye view, <br>take a hot-air balloon ride at sunrise to see the temples scattered across the lush landscape.

     <dd style="margin-left: 2px;">
        The world's largest salt flat covers 4,000 square miles of the Bolivian Altiplano. In the dry season, it's an endless white sheet of salt tiles made all the more dazzling by clear,<br> sunny skies. From December to April, however, regular rains create a mirror effect that merges lake and sky.<br> No matter when you see it, Salar de Uyuni is one of the most captivating sights on earth.
